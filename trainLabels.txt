The process of yelping involves sound source (the frame element sound_source is assigned to a constituent referring to a physical entity which emits a sound), sound (the frame element sound is incorporated in the meaning of the verbs of this frame), noisy event (an event in which one or more sound_sources participate and which is accompanied by sound).
The process of yenning involves experiencer (the experiencer is the person (or sentient being) who wishes for the event to occur), event (the change that the experiencer would like to see), focal participant (this is the entity that the experiencer wishes to be affected by some event), location of event (the location_of_event is the place involved in the desired event).
The process of yielding involves capitulator (the individual that yields to the force exerted by the compeller), issue (the matter, usually concerning a course of action, in which the capitulator has disagreed with the compeller), compeller (an individual that intentionally exerts force on the capitulator), force (a state of affairs, typically brought about by a compeller, that impinges on the capitulator and eventually causes them to no longer pursue their own view on the issue), resultant action (the action that the capitulator engages in after giving in to the force).
The process of yielding involves surrenderer (the person compelled to transfer the theme to the recipient), recipient (the entity that ends up in possession of the theme), theme (the object that changes possession).
The process of yielding involves created entity (this fe identifies the entity that the agent intentionally creates), creator (the creator creates a created entity).
The process of yodeling involves sound source (the frame element sound_source is assigned to a constituent referring to a physical entity which emits a sound), sound (the frame element sound is incorporated in the meaning of the verbs of this frame), noisy event (an event in which one or more sound_sources participate and which is accompanied by sound).
The process of yoking involves agent (the agent manipulates an object), item (this fe identifies the item that the agent attaches to the goal), goal (goal identifies the location to which an item is attached), connector (the connector forms the bond that maintains the item or items in a fixed position; it is usually expressed in a with-pp), items (this fe identifies the plural items that are tied together, resulting in their mutual attachment).
The process of yoking involves agent (the agent is the actor who instigates the filling), theme (the theme is the physical object or substance which changes location), goal (the goal is the area or container being filled), cause (an event which brings about the filling of the goal).
The process of yowling involves sound source (the frame element sound_source is assigned to a constituent referring to a physical entity which emits a sound), sound (the frame element sound is incorporated in the meaning of the verbs of this frame), noisy event (an event in which one or more sound_sources participate and which is accompanied by sound).
The process of zigzagging involves source (any expression which implies a definite starting-point of the road), path (the trajectory that would be followed by one moving on the road), goal (any expression which tells where the fictive mover travelling along a road would end up), road (a physical path that a virtual moving entity can be imagined to travel along), area (this frame element is used for expressions which describe a general area in which motion takes place when the motion is understood to be irregular and not to consist of a single linear path), path shape (the configuration formed by the entire path along the road), direction (the direction in which a "fictive" mover would travel along a road).
The process of zigzagging involves theme (the theme is the entity that changes location), source (the source is the location the theme occupies initially before its change of location), path (the path refers to (a part of) the ground over which the theme travels  or to a landmark by which the theme travels), goal (the goal is the location the theme ends up in), area (area identifies the setting in which the theme's movement takes place without a specified path), distance (distance is any expression which characterizes the extent of the motion), direction (this fe is used for expressions that indicate motion along a line from the deitic center towards a reference point (which may be implicit) that is neither the goal of the posture change nor a landmark along the way of the moving part of the body).
The process of zinging involves theme (the theme is the entity that changes location), source (the source is any expression which implies a definite starting-point of motion), path (the path is any description of a trajectory of motion which is neither a source nor a goal), goal (the goal is any expression which tells where the theme ends up as a result of the motion), area (this fe identifies the general area in which motion takes place, used particularly if the motion is understood as following a complex or non-linear path).
The process of zipping involves containing object (this fe identifies the item that is closed by the agent with the fastener), agent (the agent opens/closes the containing-object), fastener (this fe identifies the fastener that the agent manipulates), container portal (this fe identifies the active zone of the container that may be expressed as the direct object of the target verb).
The process of zonk outing involves sleeper (the sleeper is the entity that falls asleep).
